# My Coding Challenges Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various programming problems from coding platforms and coursework. I use this space to practice data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving skills.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by programming language:

-   `java/`: ☕ Contains solutions written in Java.
-   `python/`: 🐍 Contains solutions written in Python.
-   `cpp/`: ⚙️ Contains solutions written in C++.
-   `sql/`: 🗃️ Contains SQL scripts.
-   `text/`: 📄 Contains text files.

## How to Run

### Java

To compile and run a Java file:

```sh
javac FileName.java
java MainClassName
```

### Python

To run a Python script:

```sh
python script_name.py
```

### C++

To compile and run a C++ file:

```sh
g++ file_name.cpp -o output_name
./output_name
```

### SQL

To execute a SQL script, you can use a command-line client for your database system. Here is an example using `mysql`:

```sh
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < script_name.sql
```
